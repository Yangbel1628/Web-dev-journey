🌐 HTML with CSS – Practice Projects
Welcome to my HTML with CSS folder!
This is where I’m practicing and building small web projects while learning how HTML and CSS work together to create beautiful and functional websites.

📁 What's Inside?
This folder contains:

✅ Basic HTML structures

🎨 CSS styling experiments

📦 Layout designs using Flexbox & Box Model

🔘 Button and hover effects

📱 Responsive design trials

🧪 Mini-projects like cards, forms, and more

✍️ Why This Folder?
As part of my web development journey, I'm learning by doing.
These are not big projects, but real steps showing how I’ve grown — from basic tags to styled components.
I want to show my progress, consistency, and dedication to becoming a better developer.
